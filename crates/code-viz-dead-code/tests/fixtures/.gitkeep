# Test Fixtures

This directory will contain sample TypeScript projects with known dead code for integration testing.

Structure will include:
- Sample projects with intentional dead code
- Test cases for various TypeScript patterns (imports, exports, re-exports, circular dependencies)
- Edge cases (dynamic imports, test files, etc.)
