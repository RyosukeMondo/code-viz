As AI agents generate code at unprecedented speeds, codebases rapidly accumulate technical debt through redundant logic, unnecessary complexity, and dead code. Code-Viz provides real-time, visual insights into codebase health, enabling developers to maintain control and prevent systems from becoming unmaintainable black boxes.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users: Software Engineers & Tech Leads\n- **Pain Points**:\n  - Cannot keep up with reviewing massive volumes of AI-generated code\n  - Lack visibility into which AI-generated code is actually being used\n  - Struggle to identify bloated, overly complex, or dead code regions\n  - Need to understand how codebase evolved over time through AI interventions\n\n### Secondary Users: Engineering Managers & Architects\n- **Pain Points**:\n  - Require metrics to evaluate code quality trends\n  - Need to prioritize refactoring efforts based on objective data\n  - Want to understand impact of AI tools on technical debt\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **SpaceSniffer-like Treemap Visualization**\n   - Interactive 2D hierarchical view showing code volume (LOC) as rectangle size\n   - Color-coded by cognitive complexity or dead code ratio (green → yellow → red heatmap)\n   - Drill-down navigation through directory structures\n\n2. **Dead Code Detection via Semantic Analysis**\n   - Uses stack-graphs for cross-file reachability analysis\n   - Identifies unused functions, classes, and modules with function-level granularity\n   - Distinguishes between local and global dead code\n\n3. **Git History Time Travel**\n   - Timeline slider to replay codebase evolution from first to latest commit\n   - Visual highlighting of AI-generated commits (identified by author/commit message)\n   - Animated transitions showing code growth/reduction over time\n\n4. **3D Code City Visualization**\n   - Buildings represent files (height = LOC/methods, footprint = dependencies)\n   - Districts represent directories\n   - Connection lines show import/export relationships\n\n5. **AI-Specific Metrics**\n   - **AI Bloat Index**: (duplicate code × cognitive complexity) / test coverage\n   - **Zombie Code Score**: Dead code with long-term stagnation and high internal coupling\n   - **Churn Analysis**: Identify frequently-changed files correlated with complexity\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Prevent Technical Debt Accumulation**: Provide early warning signals before codebases become unmaintainable\n- **Optimize AI Tool Usage**: Help teams understand and control AI code generation impact\n- **Accelerate Refactoring Decisions**: Surface objective data to prioritize cleanup efforts\n- **Improve Code Review Efficiency**: Visual diff alternatives for massive AI-generated changes\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Adoption**: Number of repositories monitored per active user (Target: 5+ repos/user)\n- **Action Rate**: Percentage of users who delete/refactor code after viewing visualizations (Target: 40%)\n- **Time Savings**: Reduction in code review time for AI-generated PRs (Target: 30% reduction)\n- **Code Health**: Tracked improvement in dead code ratio and complexity scores over 90 days (Target: 20% improvement)\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Visual-First Cognition**\n   - Code is \"seen\" not \"read\" - leverage spatial memory and pattern recognition\n   - Use metaphors from familiar tools (SpaceSniffer) to reduce learning curve\n\n2. **Performance at Scale**\n   - Must handle codebases with 100K+ files without lag\n   - Real-time updates during active development (sub-second refresh)\n   - Incremental analysis to avoid full re-scans\n\n3. **Actionable Intelligence**\n   - Never show metrics without interpretation (no \"info for info's sake\")\n   - Prioritize findings by impact (highlight high-bloat, low-effort wins)\n   - Provide deletion confidence scores (safe-to-remove indicators)\n\n4. **Transparency & Trust**\n   - Show analysis methodology (why something is marked as dead code)\n   - Allow users to mark false positives (learning system)\n   - Preserve Git history context (who/when/why for every line)\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: Desktop application (Tauri-based) with web-based UI\n- **Real-time Updates**: File system watcher (notify) + incremental re-analysis on save\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**:\n  - Total LOC, dead code percentage, average cognitive complexity\n  - Top 10 bloated files (by AI Bloat Index)\n  - Historical trend charts (complexity/size over time)\n- **Sharing Capabilities**:\n  - Export visualizations as PNG/SVG for documentation\n  - Generate reports (JSON/CSV) for CI/CD integration\n  - Shareable snapshots with permalink to specific commit views\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\n- **Remote Access**: Cloud-hosted analysis for team collaboration; shareable dashboard URLs with read-only access\n- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions plugin to fail builds if bloat metrics exceed thresholds\n- **AI Feedback Loop**: Flag AI-generated code patterns that consistently become dead code; provide prompts to improve AI output\n- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand beyond TypeScript/JavaScript/Rust/Python to cover Go, Java, C++\n- **Collaborative Refactoring**: Multi-user mode where team members can claim/assign bloated code regions\n- **Cost Analysis**: Estimate compute/storage costs of dead code in serverless environments\n",
